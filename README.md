## Mobile app for grouping decor payments according to your categories of choice

- A new user will sign up with a username and be directed to their profile page.
- The user can start adding a list of decor. 
- On the my decor page, the user will see the list of decors created and total price of the decors at the top of the page.
- The user can organize their decor list in any categories of choice. If you don't find a category on the list of categories given to select,
- you can go to the categories page and create one. Then it will reflect on the select options tab.
- A user can also edit or delete the decors added.
